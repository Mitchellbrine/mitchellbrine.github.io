Have an idea you want to peruse? Do you not know Java or Minecraft? Would you like to see your idea come to life?

I can help. I have become a freelance modder. What this means is that you can hire me to help write the mod for you and then transfer the mod to you at any time. My rates are per month and can go from about $5 to $10, depending on the mod concept difficulty.

Most/any ideas are accepted and if you would like a mod to be created or worked on, you have a load of options to fit your liking, to make sure you get a great mod and a great experience.

## FAQ:

### Q: Can I cancel it at any time?

##### A: Yes you can. I will still work on it until the end of the month (as you have paid for a month's worth of service), but after that time, I will transfer the repository to you.

- - -

### Q: Can I make the mod closed source?

##### A: Yes, you can. You can choose either BitBucket or GitHub to host your repository where you can see the work being done *and* choose if you want your mod closed or open source.

- - -

### Q: If it is open source, can I choose a license?

##### A: Yes, it is up to you how you want your mod to be licensed. If you want a really restricting license or *even* MIT License, you choose the license, I'll put it there.

- - -

### Q: Pricing?

##### A: The pricing *really* depends on the mod idea/concept and it's difficulty. Also, if you wish to post the mod on to CurseForge and the mod gets popular, your pricing will go down (as you will be receiving credit from CurseForge itself).

- - -

### Q: Can I just transfer the mod to you if I'm done with it?

##### A: Absolutely. If you wish to be done with the mod and don't want to pay any more, you can just leave the mod to me to maintain.

- - -

### Q: What if I forget to pay?

##### A: I'll allow a week/two-week grace period for payment. I will notify at the end of the month if you haven't paid already, giving you notice of possible takeover.

- - -

### Q: Can I help with the mod's development?

##### A: Sure, why not?

- - -

### Q: Where can I get started?

##### A: Email me at awsomeman500 @ gmail.com and we can discuss a plan and payment for the mod idea. I look forward to working with you.
